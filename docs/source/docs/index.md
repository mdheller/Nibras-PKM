**Local**

The user has full control over his/her data, without the need for a (fast) internet connection, and without all the distractions and information overload that the internet can cause.

**Open source**

The user has control over the system itself too, especially when using it on the long term to manage the important personal information and files.

**Comprehensize**

It manages resources (articles, books, documents), notes, writings, tasks, goals, journal, planner, payments, indicators, and (study) courses and departments.

**Powerful**

It was designed with large amounts of information in mind. In current usage, it manages dozens of thousands of records. With its commands and saved searches, it makes easy to navigate through all the information.

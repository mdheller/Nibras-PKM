# Welcome to Nibras System Documentation

Nibras system consists of Nibras PKM and Nibras Reader.

## Nibras PKM 

**Nibras PKM** is an __offline open source system__ for the __long-term management__ of __personal__ information. It is a combination of a __web-based__ application intended for desktop use, and an Android __mobile__ reader application.

**Why offline?** The user has full control over his/her data, without the need for (fast) internet connection, and without all the distractions and information overload that the internet can cause.

**Why open source?** The user has control over the system itself too, especially when using it on the long term to manage the important personal information and files.


**It manages**: resources (articles, books, documents), notes, writings, tasks, goals, journal, planner, payments, indicators, and (study) courses and departments.

# Welcome to Nibras System Documentation

Nibras system consists of Nibras PKM and Nibras Reader.

## Nibras PKM 

**Nibras PKM** is an __offline open source system__ for the __long-term management__ of __personal__ information. It is a combination of a __web-based__ application intended for desktop use, and an Android __mobile__ reader application.

**Why offline?** The user has full control over his/her data, without the need for (fast) internet connection, and without all the distractions and information overload that the internet can cause.

**Why open source?** The user has control over the system itself too, especially when using it on the long term to manage the important personal information and files.


**It manages**: resources (articles, books, documents), notes, writings, tasks, goals, journal, planner, payments, indicators, and (study) courses and departments.

## Nibras Reader


* **Nibras Reader** is an Android application that connects to a Nibras PKM system (e.g. on the same WIFI network), and gets the bookmarked records in key modules.

* It allows the user to enter quick one-line notes that will be synced to Nibras Desktop on user's choice.


* To use Nibras Reader, the user has to specify first the IP and port of Nibras PKM (found on the footer region). Then, when clicking 'Sync', all bookmarked records will be available for reading on mobile.
